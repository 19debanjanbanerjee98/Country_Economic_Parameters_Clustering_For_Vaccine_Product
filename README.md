# Problem statement:
Clustering of countries based on country specific economic parameters imperative to the healthcare framework based on the world bank &amp; WHO data for a Vaccine Product.

# Underlying objective/Hypothesis:
Assuming ABC Pharmaceutical, an international Drug Manufacturer, committed to pursue innovation in vaccine science and technology that helps make access to vaccines more affordable and equitable in lower-income markets.
  i) The ultimate objective is to segment countries based on socio-economic factors that reflect the overall level of development within each country.
  ii) Formulate and recommend targeted strategies specific to each of these clustering segments.
  
# Solution approach:
This solution uses 4 Clustering techniques: KMeans, KMeans with Mahalanobis distance, Hierarchial and DBSCAN clustering and compares the performances of each.
We are also attaching the prelim EDA notebook(Python), utilized to analyze the different data sources available open source. The datasets used, during the exercise are resourced from Kaggle and the entire solution archetecture has been made open-source in Python programming language.

The notebooks contain visulizations using Plotly, which may not show up while reopening the notebooks, in a new user's workspace. Please refer to the HTML version of the notebooks for validation purposes.
